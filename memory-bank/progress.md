# Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. Backend API
   - YouTube video download and audio extraction
   - Whisper transcription with `small.en` model
   - Fallback to YouTube auto-captions
   - Blog post generation with Gemini API
   - Environment variable configuration

2. Frontend Application
   - YouTube URL input and validation
   - Blog customization options (audience, tone, format)
   - API integration with proper parameter passing
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Copy to clipboard functionality
   - Download as Markdown/HTML
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Current Status
- Backend and frontend are successfully integrated
- API endpoints are working as expected
- Transcription quality improved with `small.en` model
- Output formatting issues resolved
- Error handling implemented on both ends

## Known Issues
1. Long processing times for larger videos
2. Potential memory usage concerns with larger models
3. Need for better progress indication during processing

## To Be Built
1. Progress tracking for long-running operations
2. Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
3. Additional output format options
4. User preferences persistence
5. Batch processing capabilities

## Testing Status
- Basic functionality testing complete
- Need more extensive testing with:
  - Various video lengths
  - Different languages
  - Different output formats
  - Edge cases and error conditions

# Project Brief: YouTube-to-Blog Generator

## 1. Overview
This project aims to develop a web application feature that enables users to convert YouTube video content into high-quality, human-like blog posts. The core functionality involves accepting a YouTube URL, performing free transcription, and using AI to generate a blog post based on user-defined preferences for tone and type.

## 2. Core Requirements
- Accept a valid YouTube video URL.
- Provide free transcription of the video content (English only, initially).
- Generate a blog post using AI based on the transcription.
- Allow users to customize the blog's type (Tutorial, Educational, Entertainment, Informative), tone (Formal, Conversational, Humorous, Professional, Inspirational), and length (Short, Medium, Long).
- Ensure the generated blog output is natural-sounding and avoids common AI patterns.
- Provide options to copy or download the generated blog post.

## 3. Scope
### In-Scope:
- Free transcription (e.g., using Whisper or YouTube captions).
- AI-driven blog generation.
- User controls for blog type, tone, and length.
- Focus on human-like output quality.
- Basic UI for input and output.
- Handling videos up to 1 hour.

### Out-of-Scope (Initially):
- Paid transcription services.
- Video editing features.
- Multi-language support.
- Live stream support.
- Direct integration with blogging platforms.

## 4. Success Metrics (High-Level)
- High user engagement (generation & download/copy rates).
- High perceived quality of generated blogs (human-like).
- Reliable and performant processing times.
- Low error rates.
